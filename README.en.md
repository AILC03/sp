# Course: Embedded Systems


Official repository for the **Embedded Systems** course. This repository contains theoretical material, programming examples, lab assignments, and final projects focused on microcontrollers and electronic devices.


## Learning Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of embedded systems.
- Program microcontrollers in C and Assembly.
- Configure common peripherals: GPIO, timers, ADC/DAC, UART, I2C, SPI.
- Design real-world applications using embedded hardware.


## Repository Structure
- `docs/` – extended documentation and teaching guides
- `examples/` – reference code for different MCUs
- `practices/` – lab activities
- `final_project/` – integrative project
- `resources/` – datasheets, templates, and external links


## Requirements
- Basic digital electronics knowledge
- C/C++ programming skills
- Familiarity with embedded development tools (MPLAB, Keil, Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, RaspberryPi/PicoW)


## Methodology
- **Project-based learning**: progressively complex labs
- **Experimental validation**: all code must be tested on real hardware
- **Technical documentation**: datasheets and reference manuals as primary sources
